In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to answer questions about the data.

#1. Which Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US?

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil including the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

#4. Which Employees are Sales Agents?

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title= 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices;
