In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to answer questions about the data.

#1. Which Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US?

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil including the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

#4. Which Employees are Sales Agents?

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title= 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices;

#6. Show the invoices associated with each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId= emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId= cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName as 'Sales Agent First Name', emp.LastName as 'Sales Agent Last Name', inv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId= emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId= cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT invit.InvoiceLineId, tr.name 
FROM chinook.invoice_items invit
JOIN chinook.tracks tr ON tr.TrackId= invit.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT invit.InvoiceLineId, tr.name as track, ar.name as artist
FROM chinook.invoice_items invit
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks tr ON tr.TrackId= invit.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al ON al.AlbumId= TR.TrackId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.ArtistId= al.ArtistId;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

ELECT t.name as 'Track Name', a.title as 'Album Title', m.name as 'Media Type', g.name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.albumid= t.albumid 
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON m.mediatypeid= t.mediatypeid 
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.genreid= t.genreid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e 
JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON c.SupportRepId= e.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.Customerid= c.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e 
JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON c.SupportRepId= e.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.Customerid= c.CustomerId
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC
LIMIT 1;
